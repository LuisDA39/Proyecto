# Sorting Algorithms Project

This project, created for the Data Structures and Algorithms 1 course, compares various sorting algorithms based on their execution times. The theme of the project revolves around a taqueria (taco shop), and it includes several popular sorting methods implemented in C++.

## Project Description

The project is centered around a class called `comeTacos`, which contains methods to generate an array of taco orders, sort them using different algorithms, and measure the execution times of each sorting method. The results are then compared and displayed.

### Included Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented and compared in this project:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Counting Sort
5. Shell Sort
6. Quick Sort
7. Heap Sort
8. Merge Sort
9. Radix Sort

## Code Structure

- `comeTacos`: The main class containing the sorting algorithms, methods to generate and print the array, and methods to measure and display the execution times.
- `main()`: The main function where the sorting algorithms are executed and timed.

## Output
The program outputs the execution times for each sorting algorithm and then sorts and displays these times in ascending order. This allows for a clear comparison of the performance of each algorithm.
